# password_generator

A random password generator that creates a password that fits criteria selected by the user. 

Must be between 8 and 128 characters, the user will be prompted and can select four seperate criteria that the password can include; 
1. Uppercase Characters
2. Lowercase Characters
3. Numeric Characters
4. Special Characters

The generator will create the password as defined by the user. I.e.: If user selects a 9 character lenght and only Uppercase characters and Numeric characters then the created password will only include 9 Upper and Numeric characters in a random fashion. ex: (D9EJJE90S)

If the user chooses a length option outside of the 8-128 character limit the page will restart.
